# TicTacToe
This is a tic tac toe AI program written in javascript. Because Tic Tac Toe is a fixed outcome game, the AI will only ever beat or tie you. The program goes through all the possible outcomes from the player move and makes the move that will win the game in the fewest moves.

I originally created this project on glitch.com and it can be found at https://threeinarow.glitch.me/ or https://glitch.com/~threeinarow
